Roleplayers lack an online resource that gives them an ideal experience: the ability to find fandoms quickly and easily, the capability of posting, saving, and changing prompts, a real-time chat that you can come back to whenever you want, and the option of anonymity.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Everything after the colon is a requirements spec. Before the colon is a problem spec, but you should write positively and not negatively (i.e., assert what you want to create, not what doesn't exist). Consider: "We seek to create an environment that is sensitive to the specific experience requirements for roleplayers."
