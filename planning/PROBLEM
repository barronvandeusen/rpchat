PROBLEM: We're looking to create a space designed for online roleplayers that gives the community the tools and requirements for a fun and intuitive rp experience.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Everything after the colon is a requirements spec. Before the colon is a problem spec, but you should write positively and not negatively (i.e., assert what you want to create, not what doesn't exist). Consider: "We seek to create an environment that is sensitive to the specific experience requirements for roleplayers."
