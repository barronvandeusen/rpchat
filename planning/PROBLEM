In this file we will make the problem statement. This is a simple one- or two-sentence statement that identifies the issue that we are trying to solve. Remember that what we are doing here is ultimately engineering, and all engineering is problem-solving. We cannot create a solution without clearly understanding the underlying problem. This is not the time for a solution specification or any technical details.
